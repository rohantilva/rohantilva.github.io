## Intro 
I'm a junior computer science and applied mathematics double major at Johns Hopkins University, current SDE intern at Amazon, former SWE intern at Capital One and Oracle, former Varsity athlete on the JHU baseball team, member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and teaching assistant for Johns Hopkins' Machine Learning (CS475) course. I'm passionate about the intersection of technology, entertainment, healthcare, and the financial markets, and I'll be taking this semester off from school (Fall 2018) to intern at Amazon HQ in Seattle. I'm a big fan of The Office, Chef's Table, Ugly Delicious, Game of Thrones, the New York Giants, clothes, coffee, and music (check out my two favorite artists on Spotify: [Electric Guest](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7sgWBYtJpblXpJl2lU5WVs), [MØ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0bdfiayQAKewqEvaU6rXCv)).
